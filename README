This gap-package provides algorithms concerning formal characters.
As the name suggests, you need the gap-system to use it. You can download a copy
of gap from http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/index.html.

You have (at least) two possibilities to use this package.
First, if you are system admin, just open a terminal and navigate to your gap copy.
Dive into the /pkg/ folder.
Run this command:

    ln -s /path/to/your/copy/of/the/FormalCharacters-Package/FormalCharacters

This will result in gap reading the package automatically whenever you start gap.
To use it in a gap-session just type

    LoadPackage("FormalCharacters");

from within gap.

The second possibilty (if you lack root privileges) is to use the "LoadFormalCharacters.g" shipped with this package.
Just open a terminal, navigate here and type

    gap LoadFormalCharacters.g

This file will take care of everything and load the package for you.


If you have any bug-reports or feature-requests just use github's issue tracker.

Thank you and enjoy!
